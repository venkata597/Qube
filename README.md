# Qube

**Qube** is a lightweight quantum compiler prototype that translates a simple DSL (Domain-Specific Language) into executable Qiskit circuits.  
It’s designed as an educational and hackathon-friendly tool to reimagine how classical compiler ideas can extend into quantum computing.

## ✨ Features
- Minimal DSL with 8 core instructions (e.g., `QUBIT`, `H`, `X`, `CX`, `MEASURE`, etc.)
- Parser + compiler that generates Qiskit circuits
- Simple syntax inspired by low-level assembly
- Extensible design for adding more gates or optimizations
